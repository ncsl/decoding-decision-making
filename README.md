# Creating a Decoding Tool to Identify Neural Correlates of Behavior: Decision Making Case Study

The goal of this repository is to create a computational framework for decoding beavioral variables from neural data.

The particular dataset that will be used to develop this framework is a decision-making dataset, where subjects have implanted stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) electrodes that record neural data as they perform a virtual gambling game.
